# 2018CSFinal
A grid game, in which the end of the world has occurred and the overlords have granted you the power to build your own world.

Start by choosing a world and typing in a name for your world, then clicking next. To add buildings, go to the shop, click on the building you'd like (wait until it highlights), go back to the world screen, and click on a square to put it down. Different shops give you different amounts of happiness or revenue. If either of these falls below 0, you've failed to keep your little community alive. Placing buildings next to other buildings will affect the amount of revenue/happiness levels (i.e. park next to a dumpster). Have fun playing!
